                <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                <p>EduFund offers a structured Intermediate-level course designed to guide students through smarter education planning and career decision-making. It helps learners understand future study paths, financial planning basics, and global education opportunities. The course builds confidence for higher-level preparation by blending practical knowledge with expert-led guidance.</p>

                <h3>Degree</h3>
                <p>A degree-level course here works like a wide-angle lens for a student’s future. It blends deep subject understanding with guidance on careers, higher studies, and the finances needed to reach them. The idea is to prepare learners not just to earn a degree, but to navigate the world that waits beyond it.</p>

                <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
                <p>A post-graduation course steps into the territory where learning becomes specialization. It sharpens a student’s expertise, connects them with advanced research or industry pathways, and builds the confidence to operate at a professional level. It’s where knowledge stops being general and starts becoming powerfully focused.</p>

        <h1>Our Facilities</h1>
        <p>Facilities matter because they quietly shape how students think and grow. Here, the spaces are built to support focused study, hands-on practice, and moments of creativity — from modern classrooms and labs to libraries and activity areas. Everything is arranged to feel accessible, reliable, and comfortable, so learning never has to fight the environment to happen.</p>

                <h3>Basketball</h3>
                <p>The basketball facility adds a lively pulse to the campus, giving students room to move, compete, and recharge. The court is maintained for regular practice, friendly matches, and team events, making it a natural gathering spot for energy and teamwork. It encourages fitness, discipline, and the simple joy of a fast game under an open sky.</p>

                <h3>Cricket</h3>
                <p>Cricket here becomes more than a sport — it’s the rhythm of the ground, the cheer of teamwork, and the thrill of a clean shot. The facility is set up for regular practice, friendly matches, and skill-building sessions.</p>

                <h3>Kids PlayGround</h3>
                <p>A child’s play area brings a softer, brighter energy to the campus — a space where learning begins with curiosity, not rules. Safe swings, slides, and open zones let kids explore movement and imagination freely. It’s designed so laughter becomes the soundtrack and discovery becomes second nature.</p>
